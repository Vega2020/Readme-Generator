## Overview:
This is a command line application that makes it easier to write good readme files for projects. The readme is an essential part of any repository and can make or break an application's usability. This app is intended to make that process faster and easier.
        
## Installation:
First clone the repository locally in the directory you're going to use it. Open a terminal in the directory and run server.js in node. The terminal will begin bringing up prompts that walk you through the process of creating a thorough readme.
        
## Usage:
Open a terminal in the readme-generator directory and run server.js in node. The app will begin sending prompts to the command line. After filling out all the information, the readme will be saved as a text file in the output directory.
